# CS340 MongoDB Dashboard — Databases

## Description
This artifact is my **CS340 MongoDB Dashboard project**. The original version provided a basic interface for interacting with a MongoDB collection and displaying records using a Dash application. While functional, it lacked important features for usability and security, and it did not demonstrate the full potential of database integration.

For the enhancement, I focused on transforming the project into a more **secure, interactive, and user-friendly** dashboard. I added authentication features, query filtering, and improved visualization, which elevated the artifact from a simple proof-of-concept into a more realistic database application.

## Enhanced Code
- Path in this repo: [`code/enhanced/CS340_Database_Enhancement_ENHANCED.zip`](../code/enhanced/CS340_Database_Enhancement_ENHANCED.zip)

## Enhancement Narrative
I selected this artifact because it allowed me to demonstrate advanced database interaction, data security, and user experience. The enhancements showcase skills in authentication, secure data access, and interactive visualization.

Enhancements performed:
1. **Authentication System** – Added a login feature so users must authenticate before accessing the dashboard.  
2. **Query Filtering** – Implemented interactive filters to allow users to query the database by specific fields, improving data accessibility.  
3. **Improved Visualization** – Enhanced charts and tables to better communicate query results, making the dashboard more useful for real users.  

### Reflection
Enhancing this project taught me how to balance database security with usability. Implementing authentication introduced challenges with session handling, which I solved by integrating a lightweight system suitable for the scale of the project. Adding filtering required adjusting MongoDB queries and validating user input to prevent issues. Overall, this enhancement demonstrates my ability to design database applications that are secure, maintainable, and user-focused.
