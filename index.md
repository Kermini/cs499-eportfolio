# Koda Ermini — CS-499 ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This site presents my enhanced artifacts in **Software Engineering & Design**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**, along with reflections and a professional self-assessment.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown from someone focused mainly on writing code to a professional capable of designing, developing, and evaluating complete computing solutions. This course, **CS-499**, has been the culmination of that journey. By enhancing three artifacts that represent **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **databases**, I have been able to showcase the depth of my learning and demonstrate skills directly applicable to the workplace.

### Artifact Highlights

**Software Design and Engineering – CS360 Weight Tracker Application**  
This artifact represented my foundation in software design and engineering. Enhancing the project required me to restructure the code, refine the user interface, and improve maintainability. This experience allowed me to practice designing software with end-users in mind and reinforced the importance of writing clean, scalable code.

**Algorithms and Data Structures – CS300 ProjectTwo (C++ Data Structures)**  
I enhanced this project by improving the efficiency and logic of the data handling, while ensuring that the solution remained clear and maintainable. This work highlighted my ability to approach problems algorithmically, weigh trade-offs in design decisions, and implement data structures that meet specific problem requirements.

**Databases – CS340 MongoDB Dashboard**  
Enhancements included adding a login system and query filtering features, elevating the project from a static dashboard into an interactive, secure application. This artifact demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, implement security measures, and design user-friendly interfaces that communicate results effectively.

Together, these artifacts show that I can take projects from initial design through enhancement and delivery, while applying best practices in security, usability, and maintainability.

### Program Learning Outcomes

**Employ strategies for building collaborative environments**  
I have consistently demonstrated collaboration in both academic and professional settings, including contributing to team projects, reviewing peer work, and presenting my own projects clearly. In CS-499, I applied these skills by producing documentation and narratives that allow others — including instructors and potential employers — to understand my design decisions and results.

**Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications**  
Through the narratives, journals, and this self-assessment, I have practiced creating technical documentation that is clear, organized, and tailored to the audience. My GitHub repository and ePortfolio serve as professional communications, showcasing not just code but also my ability to explain complex topics.

**Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles**  
My CS300 enhancement exemplified this outcome by requiring me to evaluate and improve the efficiency of algorithms and data structures. In doing so, I demonstrated the ability to apply algorithmic thinking to real problems, evaluate trade-offs, and deliver solutions that balance performance and clarity.

**Demonstrate innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices**  
The CS340 dashboard enhancement is evidence of this outcome. By integrating authentication, query filtering, and visualization, I applied innovative techniques and industry-relevant tools such as MongoDB, Dash, and Flask. These improvements show my ability to move beyond basic functionality and deliver features that align with industry expectations for secure, scalable, and user-focused applications.

**Develop a security mindset**  
Each enhancement was completed with security in mind. From restructuring the CS360 Weight Tracker for maintainability, to applying efficiency improvements in CS300 with secure logic, to building authentication into the CS340 dashboard, I demonstrated awareness of vulnerabilities and integrated security measures to strengthen the artifacts.

### Conclusion

The Computer Science program has given me the technical foundation, problem-solving skills, and professional communication abilities needed to succeed in the field. My work in CS-499 demonstrates not only what I have learned, but also how I can apply those skills to add value in a professional setting. This professional self-assessment highlights the expertise I bring to the workforce: a balance of strong technical ability, practical experience, and a mindset for continuous learning.
